# Canonical methodology launcher

[`canonical_methodology_colab.py`](canonical_methodology_colab.py) is the lightweight,
Drive-backed Colab entry point for the public methodology. It clones a selected repository
revision, reuses registered training checkpoints and datasets, and dispatches dense, 1-hop,
k-hop, and k-hop plus VNode GRIT tasks through
`graph_specialisation_metrics.methodology.colab.run`.

The normative scientific specification is
[`../../src/graph_specialisation_metrics/README.md`](../../src/graph_specialisation_metrics/README.md).
The implementation boundary and output layout are documented in
[`../../src/graph_specialisation_metrics/methodology/README.md`](../../src/graph_specialisation_metrics/methodology/README.md).

Edit only the task list, training seeds, requested phases, checkpoint overrides, and run sizes in
the launcher. Methodological definitions belong in the canonical package, not in the Colab cell.
